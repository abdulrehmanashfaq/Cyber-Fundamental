Forensic Notes: ICMP Tunneling & Data Exfiltration
1. Overview: The Concept of Tunneling

Tunneling is a technique where an adversary wraps one protocol inside another to bypass network security controls (Firewalls, IDS/IPS).

    SSH Tunneling: Bypasses port restrictions by wrapping DB/Web traffic inside Port 22.

    ICMP Tunneling: Bypasses protocol filters by hiding data inside the "Data Field" of an ICMP Echo Request (Ping).


2. ICMP Tunneling Mechanism

Attackers append data to the payload section of an ICMP packet. Since ICMP is often allowed through firewalls to test connectivity, it provides a "quiet" path for Command & Control (C2) or exfiltration.
3. Identification & Forensic Analysis

To find ICMP tunneling in a packet capture (e.g., icmp_tunneling.pcapng), use the following indicators:
A. Data Length Abnormality

    Normal ICMP: Usually contains a small, standard payload (e.g., 32 or 48 bytes) often consisting of the alphabet or a timestamp.

    Suspicious ICMP: Large data lengths (e.g., 38,000 bytes) or fragmentation. If the ICMP packet is significantly larger than the standard 48-64 bytes, it is likely being used for tunneling.

B. Payload Inspection

In Wireshark, examine the Data portion of the ICMP packet.

    Cleartext Exfiltration: You may see sensitive data like usernames, passwords, or system info directly in the hex/ASCII dump.

    Encoded Exfiltration: Advanced attackers use Base64 or encryption.

4. Detection Workflow (Blue Team)

    Filter: Use icmp in the Wireshark filter bar.

    Sort: View the "Length" column to find the largest packets.

    Inspect: Right-click a suspicious packet -> Follow -> ICMP Stream (if available) or view the raw bytes.

    Baseline: Note that any ICMP data length > 48 bytes should be considered suspicious in a strictly controlled environment.

5. Prevention & Mitigation

    Block ICMP: If ping is not strictly required for business operations, block ICMP Echo Requests (Type 8) at the network perimeter.

    Payload Inspection: Use Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) to look for data within ICMP packets or to drop packets exceeding a specific payload size.

    Rate Limiting: Limit the number of ICMP packets allowed per second from a single source to slow down exfiltration.
