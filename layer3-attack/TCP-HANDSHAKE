#  TCP Traffic Analysis: Protocol Abuse & Reconnaissance

This guide explains how attackers manipulate the fundamental rules of the TCP protocol to map networks and identify vulnerable services.

## The Foundation: The Standard 3-Way Handshake

A legitimate TCP connection follows a strict, predictable sequence to ensure both hosts are ready for data transfer:

1. **SYN (Synchronize)**: The client requests a connection.
2. **SYN/ACK (Synchronize/Acknowledge)**: The server acknowledges the request and sends its own synchronize signal.
3. **ACK (Acknowledge)**: The client confirms receipt, and the virtual circuit is established.

 Dive: Scanning Mechanics & Behavioral Logic

### 1. SYN Scanning (The Half-Open Probe)

This is the most common scanning method because it is fast and "stealthy" at the application layer.

* **The Logic**: Instead of completing the handshake, the attacker sends a **RST (Reset)** immediately after receiving the **SYN/ACK**.
* **Why it works**: By sending the RST, the connection is never fully established. Most application-layer logs (like web servers) only record a connection *after* the final ACK is received.
* **Detection Pattern**: Look for a single host sending a high volume of SYN packets followed immediately by RST packets to the same ports.

### 2. The "Inverse Mapping" Scans (NULL, FIN, and Xmas)

These scans rely on **RFC 793 behavior**, which dictates how a TCP stack must handle packets that do not belong to an active connection.

* **NULL Scan**: Sends a packet with **zero flags** set.
* **FIN Scan**: Sends a packet with only the **FIN** flag, as if ending a connection that never started.
* **Xmas Scan**: Sets the **FIN, PSH, and URG** flags simultaneously.

**The Diagnostic Logic**:

* **If the Port is Closed**: The target OS is required by protocol rules to send an **RST**.
* **If the Port is Open**: The target OS typically ignores the "illegal" packet and sends **no response**.
* **The "Stealth" Benefit**: These scans often bypass older, non-stateful firewalls that are only configured to look for "New Connection" SYN packets.

### 3. ACK Scanning (Firewall Probing)

Unlike other scans, the ACK scan is not used to find open ports. It is used to map **Firewall Access Control Lists (ACLs)**.

* **The Strategy**: The attacker sends an **ACK** packet (which normally only follows a SYN/ACK).
* **Filtered Response**: If the attacker receives **no response**, the port is likely protected by a stateful firewall that dropped the "out-of-state" packet.
* **Unfiltered Response**: If the target sends an **RST**, the port is "unfiltered," meaning the firewall allowed the packet through, even if the service port itself is closed.

##Analyzing Flags for Threat Hunting

When reviewing traffic, look for these "Red Flags" that indicate malicious intent:

* **Flag Overload**: "Spaghetti" traffic, such as the Xmas scan, where flags like PSH and URG are used in ways that serve no functional purpose for the service being hit.
* **Unidirectional RSTs**: Seeing thousands of RST packets leaving your server without any successful data transfers preceding them is a sign your server is responding to a massive scan.
* **The "One-to-Many" Pattern**: A single source IP hitting multiple ports on one host (Vertical Scan) or one port across many hosts (Horizontal Scan).

##Summary Matrix for Security Analysts

| Attack Type |         Flags Used       |       Open Port Behavior       |       Closed Port Behavior       |       Primary Goal        |

| **SYN Scan**  |           SYN          |        SYN/ACK (then RST)      |              RST                 |        Quick Recon        |
| **NULL Scan** |          None          |         No Response            |              RST                 |        OS Fingerprinting  |
| **Xmas Scan** |     FIN, PSH, URG      |         No Response            |              RST                 |        Firewall Evasion   |
| **ACK Scan**  |          ACK           |             RST                |              RST                 |        Map Filtered Ports |

##Defensive Strategies

1. Stateful Inspection**: Use firewalls that track the state of a connection. A stateful firewall will block an ACK or FIN packet if it didn't see the initial SYN.
2. Ingress Filtering**: Block all "impossible" packets, such as those with no flags (NULL) or illegal combinations (Xmas) at the network edge.
3. Rate Limiting**: Monitor for a high frequency of RST packets leaving your network, as this is a byproduct of being scanned.
