1. Phase 1: The Digital Fingerprint (ARP Scanning)

Before an attacker can launch an "Evil Twin" or "Man-in-the-Middle" attack, they must map the network. They use ARP Scanning to see who is "alive."
The Anatomy of a Scan

In a standard network, ARP requests happen naturally as people connect. In a Scan, the behavior changes:

    Sequential Requests: A single MAC address sends requests for .1, then .2, then .3, and so on, across the entire subnet.

    Non-existent Hosts: The attacker asks for IPs that aren't assigned to anyone. On a normal network, you don't ask for someone who isn't there.

    Tool Signature: This is exactly what tools like Nmap or Netdiscover do.

2. Phase 2: The Network Blackout (Subnet-Wide DoS)

Once the scanner identifies all live hosts, the attacker can move from "spying" on one person to crashing the entire office.
How the Attack Escalates:

    Targeting the Gateway: The attacker tells the Router: "Every single IP on this network now belongs to my MAC address." This poisons the router's entire ARP table.

    Targeting the Clients: The attacker broadcasts to the entire subnet: "I am the Gateway (192.168.10.1)."

    The Result: All traffic from the clients goes to the attacker, and all traffic from the internet goes to the attacker. If the attacker doesn't forward it, the entire subnet goes offline.

3. Investigation & "Hunting" Commands
Detecting the Scan (Reconnaissance)

Use this Wireshark filter to see if someone is "knocking on every door": arp.opcode == 1 && eth.src == [Source_MAC] Look for 10+ requests in a single second to sequential IPs.
Detecting the DoS (The Attack)

To see if the attacker is claiming every IP on the network: arp.duplicate-address-detected && arp.opcode == 2 If you see this warning appearing for multiple different IP addresses but pointing to the same MAC, you are witnessing a subnet-wide poison attack.
CLI Investigation (TShark)

To quickly identify the scanner's MAC from a capture file:
Bash

# This extracts the target IPs being requested by a specific MAC
tshark -r ARP_Scan.pcapng -Y "eth.src == 08:00:27:53:0c:ba" -T fields -e arp.dst.proto_ipv4

4. Response & Remediation (Incident Response)

When you detect these anomalies, your documentation should suggest these "Real World" steps:

    Step 1: Physical Tracing: The attacker’s MAC address is tied to a physical device. Check your switch's MAC address table to find which physical port that device is plugged into.

        Command (Cisco/Managed Switch): show mac address-table address [Attacker_MAC]

    Step 2: Port Shutdown: Once identified, "shut" the port to isolate the attacker.

        Command: interface [Port_ID] -> shutdown

    Step 3: Containment: If the attack is coming over Wi-Fi (like an Evil Twin), use a "Deauthentication" tool against the attacker's radio to stop their broadcast.
