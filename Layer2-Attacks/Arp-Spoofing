1. Protocol Fundamentals: The "Vanilla" ARP

To detect anomalies, we must understand the baseline. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) maps Layer 3 (IP) addresses to Layer 2 (MAC) addresses.

The standard handshake:

    Request (Opcode 1): Host A broadcasts: "Who has IP 192.168.10.4? Tell 192.168.10.5"

    Reply (Opcode 2): Host B unicasts: "192.168.10.4 is at 50:eb:f6:ec:0e:7f"

    Caching: Host A stores this mapping in its ARP Cache to avoid constant broadcasting.

2. The Mechanics of the Attack

ARP Poisoning exploits the "trusting" nature of the protocol. It does not require a request to send a reply (Gratuitous ARP).

    The Goal: Redirect traffic through the attacker's machine.

    The Method: The attacker sends counterfeit ARP replies to both the Victim and the Gateway (Router).

        To Victim: "I am the Gateway" (Attacker's MAC + Gateway's IP).

        To Gateway: "I am the Victim" (Attacker's MAC + Victim's IP).

    Outcome: * DoS: Attacker drops the traffic.

        MITM: Attacker forwards the traffic (often leading to SSL Stripping or DNS Spoofing).

3. Hands-on Detection Workflow
A. Traffic Capture

If you are on a Linux-based system, use tcpdump to capture raw traffic for analysis:
Bash

# Install tcpdump
sudo apt install tcpdump -y

# Capture traffic on eth0 and write to a file
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w ARP_Spoof.pcapng

B. Wireshark Analysis (The "Red Flags")

When analyzing ARP_Spoof.pcapng, use these specific filters to find the attacker:
Analysis Goal	Wireshark Filter
Isolate ARP only	arp
Find Duplicate IPs	arp.duplicate-address-detected && arp.opcode == 2
Track Specific MAC	eth.addr == 08:00:27:53:0c:ba
Find Original IPs	(arp.opcode) && (eth.src == 08:00:27:53:0c:ba)

Key Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):

    Address Duplication: Wireshark flags an IP mapped to two different MAC addresses.

    High Frequency: A single host incessantly broadcasting ARP replies.

    IP Transition: Finding a MAC address that was historically linked to one IP (e.g., .5) suddenly claiming to be another (e.g., .4).

4. Verification via Command Line

If you suspect an attack is happening live on your Linux machine, check your local cache:
Bash

# Look for the suspicious MAC address in your local table
arp -a | grep 08:00:27:53:0c:ba

If you see two different IPs associated with that same attacker MAC, you are currently being spoofed.
5. Mitigation Strategies

    Static ARP Entries: Manually map critical IPs (like the Gateway) to MACs. (High maintenance, but un-spoofable).

    Port Security: Configure switches to allow only one MAC address per physical port.

    DAI (Dynamic ARP Inspection): A security feature in high-end switches that validates ARP packets against a trusted database.
